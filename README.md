# Movie App Project

<p>The Movie App project is a prototype for a movie streaming platform designed to showcase its look and basic functionality. This project involves building a dynamic movie list page using JavaScript and JSON, with a focus on creativity and unique features to stand out from competitors. It will evolve through several weekly tasks, introducing new features and refining existing ones.</p>

## Core Features and Functionalities

### 1. Movie List Display
<ul>
<li>Dynamically render a grid of movies on the page.</li>
<li>Each movie card includes key information such as: title, description, release year, director, main actors, poster image, price.</li>
</ul>

### 2. Interactivity and User Engagement
<ul>
<li><b>Comments:</b> Users can submit comments for each movie. These comments will be displayed dynamically below the movie card.</li>
<li><b>Star Ratings:</b> Allow users to rate movies using a star-rating system. The submitted rating will be displayed.</li>
</ul>

### 3. Movie Management
<ul>
<li><b>Search:</b> Users can search for movies by entering keywords in a search bar.</li>
<li><b>Sorting:</b>  Movies can be sorted based on different properties, such as release year, title, or price.</li>
<li><b>Filtering:</b> Implement filters to display movies based on specific criteria, like movies released before or after a certain year.</li>
</ul>

### 4. Timers
<ul>
<li>A countdown timer for selecting a movie, alerting the user when time is up.</li>
<li>A session timer to show how long the user has been on the page.</li>
</ul>

### 5. Fetching Data from API
<ul>
<li>Replace the static movie array with a custom API built to fetch movie data.</li>
<li>Refactor the app to ensure smooth functionality with data fetched from the API using both promise chaining and async/await.</li>
</ul>

### 6. Refinement and Advanced Features
<ul>
<li>Use advanced JavaScript concept like asynchronous programming to enhance functionality.</li>
<li>Apply further improvements to the UI and functionality, making the app ready for presentation.</li>
</ul>

## Project Goals

<ul>
<li><b>User Experience:</b> Create a visually appealing interface that engages users.</li>
<li><b>Functionality:</b> Ensure smooth interaction through search, sort, and filter features.</li>
<li><b>Technical Mastery:</b> Showcase skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, API handling, and asynchronous programming.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project is a great opportunity to demonstrate creativity and technical proficiency, resulting in a functional and visually engaging movie platform prototype.</p>
