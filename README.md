# Movie App Project

<p>The Movie App project is a prototype for a movie streaming platform designed to showcase its look and basic functionality. This project involves building a dynamic movie list page using JavaScript and JSON, with a focus on creativity and unique features to stand out from competitors. It will evolve through several weekly tasks, introducing new features and refining existing ones.</p>
